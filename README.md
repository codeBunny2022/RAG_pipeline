## Workflow

- **Resume Upload:** Front-end sends resumes to the ingestion microservice.
<br><br>
- **Preprocessing:** Ingestion service parses the resume and passes it to the preprocessing microservice.
<br><br>
- **Clustering & Categorization:** Preprocessing results are clustered and categorized based on resume content.
<br><br>
- **RAG Matching:** A job description is uploaded, and the RAG service retrieves relevant resumes from the vector store.
<br><br>
- **Grading & Ranking:** Scores are computed for each resume based on the job description and predefined criteria.
<br><br>

- **Reporting:** The top resumes are ranked, and a report is generated.
<br><br>
- **Search:** Users can search or filter resumes through the search microservice.

# Workflow for Scalable Resume Shortlisting System

## 1. Resume Ingestion Layer
- **Objective**: Collect resumes from users in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.), and store them for further processing.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Frontend**: Web interface (React/Angular) for resume upload.
  - **Backend**: REST API (FastAPI/Django) to handle upload requests.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accept resumes in bulk or individually.
  - Upload resumes to cloud storage (e.g., S3 bucket in AWS, Google Cloud Storage).
  - Queue incoming resumes for processing via **message queue** (e.g., **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, or **AWS SQS**) for scaling.

---

## 2. Resume Parsing & Preprocessing Layer
- **Objective**: Parse resumes to extract structured data (skills, experience, education, etc.), and clean the text for further embedding generation.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Resume Parsing API/Library**: SpaCy, PyResparser, NLP libraries.
  - **Text Preprocessing**: Custom Python scripts (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- **Functionality**:
  - Process resumes from the message queue.
  - Parse relevant fields such as name, contact information, education, skills, and experience.
  - Clean and normalize text for embedding generation.
  - Save structured data (JSON) and raw text for each resume to a database (e.g., **PostgreSQL**).
- **Scaling**:
  - Use worker nodes (via **Celery**, **AWS Lambda**) to parallelize the parsing and preprocessing of resumes.

---

## 3. Embedding Generation Layer
- **Objective**: Convert resume text and job descriptions into embeddings using **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** or any other suitable model.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Embedding Model**: **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** or any transformer-based model (fine-tuned if needed).
  - **Storage**: Vector database (e.g., **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, **Milvus**).
- **Functionality**:
  - Generate embeddings for each parsed resume and job description (provided by users as search queries).
  - Store these embeddings in a **vector database** for fast retrieval.
- **Scaling**:
  - Deploy the embedding generation as a microservice.
  - Use GPUs for fast embedding generation in bulk.

---

## 4. Resume Storage and Indexing Layer
- **Objective**: Store resume embeddings and metadata in a way that supports fast retrieval during search.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Vector Database**: **FAISS** (on-premise) or **Pinecone**/ **Milvus** (cloud-based vector database).
  - **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for storing parsed resume metadata (skills, experience, etc.).
- **Functionality**:
  - Store embeddings and associated resume metadata.
  - Build an efficient index for searching resumes based on user-provided job descriptions.
- **Scaling**:
  - Vector databases like FAISS scale with large datasets by partitioning data and utilizing GPU acceleration.
  - Cloud databases (like Pinecone) offer managed services for automatic scaling and indexing.

---

## 5. Retrieval Layer (Query Handling)
- **Objective**: Retrieve the top N resumes based on the similarity between job descriptions and resume embeddings.
- **Technologies**:
  - **FAISS** (for nearest neighbor search).
  - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Optionally use GPT-3 or similar for summarizing retrieved results.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accept job descriptions or search queries from users.
  - Convert the job description into an embedding.
  - Use FAISS (or another vector database) to retrieve the top N resumes based on cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.
  - **Optional**: Use RAG (retriever + generator) to generate summaries explaining why certain candidates are a good fit for the role.
- **Scaling**:
  - Use parallel queries and distributed databases to handle multiple search requests simultaneously.

---

## 6. Machine Learning-Based Ranking Layer
- **Objective**: Rank retrieved resumes using additional criteria (experience, education, skills, etc.).
- **Technologies**:
  - **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
- **Functionality**:
  - Score each retrieved resume based on additional features such as:
    - Skills match (percentage of required skills present).
    - Years of relevant experience.
    - Education and certification fit.
  - Use a weighted score to rank candidates in descending order.
- **Scaling**:
  - Batch processing for ranking candidates, with models deployed on scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., **AWS Sagemaker**, **Google AI Platform**).

---

## 7. Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement
- **Objective**: Continuously improve the system by collecting user feedback on search results and refining the models.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Active Learning**: Incorporate a feedback mechanism for recruiters to mark resumes as "relevant" or "irrelevant."
- **Functionality**:
  - Collect feedback on shortlists provided to recruiters.
  - Use the feedback to fine-tune both the **embedding model** (for better retrieval) and the **ranking model** (for improved scoring).

---

## 8. Frontend (User Interface Layer)
- **Objective**: Provide an interface where recruiters can upload resumes, search for candidates, and view ranked lists of candidates.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Frontend**: React/Angular for building user-friendly interfaces.
  - **Backend**: FastAPI/Django to handle user interactions and connect to the backend services.
- **Functionality**:
  - Resume upload and management.
  - Search interface where recruiters can input job descriptions and get ranked results.
  - Display summaries and details about top candidates.

---

## 9. Deployment and Monitoring
- **Objective**: Deploy the system to handle real-time resume uploads and search queries while ensuring performance and reliability.
- **Technologies**:
  - **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (S3 for storage, EC2 for compute, RDS for databases), GCP, or Azure.
  - **Containerization and Orchestration**: **Docker**, **Kubernetes** for deploying scalable microservices.
  - **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana for monitoring system health and performance.
- **Scaling**:
  - Auto-scaling for microservices handling embedding generation, search, and retrieval.
  - Serverless functions (AWS Lambda) for on-demand tasks like resume parsing and embedding generation.
